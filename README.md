## Meu processo

### Construído com

- HTML 5 semântico 
- CSS Sass e padrão BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### Maiores desafios

Este é o meu primeiro projeto usando local storage, guardado os dados referente as tarefas e o último tema utilizado pelo usuário, permitindo que o usuário sempre tenha acesso as tarefas.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
